Bias in Neuroinformatics


Prolog:
    Assumptions/Motivation: (not saying that it's our task Ã¤hm)
    - Biases are used/ occur in every computer program algorithm (mathematical formulae), it is surrounding us all the time and this is why its important to discuss.
alternative/ addition:    
 what is it for   to assess how good an estimator is 
    
What is a Bias? 

    - In real life we estimate a lot, the footpath to goal, relations and computations. 
       - In neuroinformatics it's the same. --> In all of the problems we can find an estimator.     (I sounds like there needs to be, it is there is the possibility to use, right?)
       (Do you mean this? script: "everything can be an estimator")
    - So the bias is: the Difference between the real value and our estimation (which we made up) is the bias.
    
1  it also gives us a startung point of how to make our estimate better 
    
    - The Dart example:
                  - Applied on the example we might think of throwing darts onto a dartboard. 
                  (- We might estimate the distance to the bulls eye and how much force is needed to throw the arrow onto the target.) And throw a few times.
                  - Unluckerly we miss our goal and hit the dartboard a little bit to much on the right side every time.
                  - The calculated bias would be the difference from the position we threw and the actual goal - The bulls eye.

1   we incorrporate the knowledge of being drawn to one side to make it better

    - Can there be other types of biases?
                 ( - The proof that the sample variance is biased and needs the bessel's correction 1 (but this don't answers the question fully?))
                   there can be a lot of instances in which a bias is there, var is one of them, 
                   other interpretations non mathematically have the same cronotation of prefering sth and neglecting sth else
    
    
    
Give reasons for bias and discuss the behaviour of the bias for large number of data samples:
    
     - Another example The Population of crane (Kraniche) big beautiful birds:
                  - When we would larger the sample size from n=10,100,999 Population size = 1000
                  - The bias becomes more and more irrevelant / less and less pronounced. b(ation)= estimation - real value
                  - The bias would conjugate to 0. (is that so? i just don't know)
                              
                  
Epilog:

    - How revelant is the information. ->What do you mean?
    - Maybe we notice that by simplifying (sampling, using model) there could appear biases. 
    But computations are more quickly/ help us out when we don't have access to full knowledge,
    help us abstracting & comparing.
